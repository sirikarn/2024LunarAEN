    <h1>2024 Horoscope for the Rooster</h1>

    <img src="../images/rooster.png" alt="Rooster Zodiac Sign" width="300">

    <p>
        Good news, Rooster! Since the Rooster horoscope is in harmony with the God of Tai Sui this year, you can look
        forward to a stellar year in 2024, with special blessings in love, wealth, and career.

        A different God of Tai Sui governs each year, and since this year's Tai Sui looks favorably on you, Rooster,
        you'll find that all your endeavors will go smoothly, and opportunities will crop up unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Rooster's 2024 Love and Relationships Forecast
    </h2>
    <p>

        The year 2024 is so fortunate for you, Rooster, that you'll enjoy better relationships all around—from friends,
        family, mentors, and of course, potential romantic partners! It reflects a new maturity in your behavior.

        Single Roosters will meet a few eligible singles that helpful friends and family send your way this year. The
        only difficulty is deciding which of them tugs at your heartstrings in just the right way.

        Roosters who are married may well welcome a new member to the family. On the other hand, if you've let go of a
        person you haven't stopped thinking about, Rooster, try and get them back!
    </p>
    <h2>
        Career Prospects for Rooster in 2024
    </h2>
    <p>
        After a tough 2023 in the workplace, you can breathe easy in 2024, Rooster. You'll excel naturally, and each
        time you put in your 110% effort—you being you—you'll see a return in folds.

        You might have felt lost last year, but with ample opportunity to prove your talent this year, Rooster, you'll
        find a few well-appointed mentors who're ready to give guidance or even lend a helping hand.

        This is definitely a year for career advancement, but keep upgrading your skills—maybe some Coursera classes are
        in order? That way, you'll never have to fear becoming redundant, even in the worst economic climate.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Rooster's Wealth and Finance in 2024
    </h2>
    <p>
        Frankly speaking, Rooster, you may well end the year of 2024 by becoming FIRE—attaining financial independence
        and ready to retire! Being a workaholic, you probably won't, but it doesn't hurt to have the choice.

        This is because on top of your growing income, Rooster, you will likely have a few other funds coming in.
        Perhaps it's an investment you've forgotten about or a generous trust from a loving relative.

        Whether you decide to reinvest your earnings or buy a sweet little house, you won't even remember how the lean
        years before felt like by the end of 2024. Breathe a deep sigh of relief!
    </p>
    <h2>
        Health Predictions for Roosters in 2024
    </h2>
    <p>
        Like all other areas of life, you'll enjoy good health in 2024, Rooster. Even those minor ailments will have
        suddenly disappeared—it's because you're growing more confident, and little things simply can't bug you anymore.

        But with all the excitement of the year, you may forget to eat or sleep—there just aren't enough hours in the
        day for you to live large, right, Rooster? Of course, those aren't negotiable. Roosters are often picky eaters,
        but that doesn't mean you should skip a meal.

        So take care of the basics of your body, Rooster, and your body will take care of you. We know you have more
        that you're aspiring to beyond 2024; keeping up your health is key!
