    <h1>2024 Horoscope for the Ox</h1>

    <img src="../images/ox.jpg" alt="Ox Zodiac Sign" width="300">
    <p>
        The Ox usually enjoys a peaceful and simple life, but 2024 isn't slated to be such a year for them since it's
        their year of “Fan Tai Sui”—or offending the God of Tai Sui.

        This is the year when the Ox cannot lay low as they usually do but must work hard just to maintain the status
        quo. Find out how to combat the negative influence of Tai Sui below.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Ox's 2024 Love and Relationships Forecast</h2>
    <p>
        The Ox's romantic life won't be stellar in 2024, but it won't be too difficult either since the auspicious Tai
        Yin star is in their corner to provide some much-needed appeasement for the Tai Sui.

        Single Oxen stand a good chance to meet a variety of potential love interests. If they can lower their
        inflexible standard somewhat, they may still end the year on a positive note with someone special.

        Paired-off and married Oxen must face a myriad of conflicts in their relationship. Whatever you do, Ox, please
        don't avoid your partner and increase their resentment over time. Actually, facing your problems together is
        advised.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Career Prospects for Ox in 2024
    </h2>
    <p>The Ox's career may stall in 2024 at best. In addition, there is one more minor inauspicious aspect in your
        quarter, making you emotionally drained and seemingly unable to throw yourself into work with your usual energy.

        You may find yourself prone to minor errors throughout the year, and your work performance will be lackluster as
        a result. Management won't be thrilled, and this only adds to the pressure you already must face, Ox.

        Thankfully, “Tian De” is redeeming you in this area, lending you much-needed professional help in the guise of a
        mentor or an understanding superior. By year-end, you at least won't lose any career progress.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Ox's Wealth and Finance in 2024
    </h2>
    </p>Unfortunately, wealth and finance are where Tai Sui will hit Oxen the hardest in 2024. As careful and methodical
    as the Ox is in life, they'll have to face major expenses due to unforeseen circumstances.

    It'll help to take extra precautions—lock your doors and keep your stuff close. Thankfully, a minor auspicious star
    promises that each time you run into trouble, it'll resolve with a little time and effort.

    By the way, thank your frugal self in previous years, Ox, for you wouldn't be who you are without abundant savings,
    and this is a year when that financial cushioning will help you go far.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Health Predictions for Oxen in 2024
    </h2>
    <p>Accidents—mostly minor, thankfully—will be more likely for the Ox this year, so we must advise for prudence. Stay
        out of dangerous situations, and do look both ways when you cross the street, Ox!

        You usually don't have to do much to maintain your health, but this year you would be well-served to work out
        and build up your physique to stave off minor ailments and discomforts in 2024.

        Oxen have the tendency to be homebodies at times. But jogging in the park or going hiking will not only mean
        exercising your body but also relaxing your stressed-out psyche in 2024 when surprises abound.
