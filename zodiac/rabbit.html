    <h1>2024 Horoscope for the Rabbit</h1>

    <img src="../images/rabbit.png" alt="Rabbit Zodiac Sign" width="300">

    <p>
        After a tough zodiac year, Rabbits will still need to withstand considerable pressure in 2024 since Dragon
        clashes with Rabbit, meaning it's Rabbit's year of “Fan Tai Sui,” or offending the God of Tai Sui.

        Even though inauspicious signs abound for Rabbits, as long as you stay positive and under the radar—don't take
        unnecessary trips or outings, and keep an upbeat mindset—this year won't be impossible to navigate.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Rabbit's 2024 Love and Relationships Forecast
    </h2>
    <p>Rabbit's love life will take the heaviest hit by Tai Sui in 2024, which must be awful news for this romantic
        group, but bad luck, like good, comes around to everyone, so it'll be okay.

        Single Rabbits will either face a complete void of eligible romantic interests or, even worse, keep coming
        across people with player energy who have the potential to break their hearts. Do be careful, Rabbit!

        Rabbits who already have a significant other may have a case of the infamous Rabbit neuroticism all year. Do
        they still love me? Are they seeing someone else? These questions will run through Rabbit's mind.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Career Prospects for Rabbit in 2024
    </h2>
    <p>In 2024, Rabbit may find it difficult to give work their all, either because they're feeling scattered with worry
        or else too tired from the Tai Sui influence to focus on the tasks at hand.

        Their supervisor won't take that well, especially because Rabbit is usually a charming and quick contributor at
        work. As such, Rabbit is advised to leave other concerns out of their mind and always stay present.

        One more word of advice: don't spill all your secrets in the office—actually, don't spill any of your secrets,
        Rabbit! “Friends” from work may very well turn around and stab you in the back.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Rabbit's Wealth and Finance in 2024
    </h2>
    <p>It's likely a year of mediocre or less-than-expected income for Rabbits, compounded by higher-than-expected
        expenses. That's not a winning formula. It also doesn't help that Rabbit will feel unmotivated in 2024.

        Usually, Rabbits are known for their elegance and taste for the finer things in life. But try not to invest in
        anything that can wait, Rabbit, as other expenses in 2024 may be more urgent.

        It's at least fortunate that Tian Yi, an auspicious star, is in Rabbit's quarter and offsetting the negative
        effect of Tai Sui. If Rabbit is in dire financial straits, they'll receive help from many loved ones.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Health Predictions for Rabbits in 2024
    </h2>
    <p> As already mentioned, it'd serve Rabbit to stay home more this year, although that doesn't mean they should be
        on the couch instead of getting enough exercise—a sturdier physique would really help in 2024.

        With Tai Sui's meddling, Rabbit may be illness-prone this year, but nothing too troublesome is in the stars.
        What you can do is have regular check-ups and go see the doctor if anything feels off.

        Take care of your digestion, Rabbit. You're already delicate in this area, and in 2024, be extra careful not to
        eat anything overly taxing on your system, and you'll end the year in fine shape.
