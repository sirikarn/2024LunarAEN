Dragon’s Horoscope for 2024 (Year of the Dragon)
Prepare for a very bad year, Dragon, as each sign must on their zodiac year, because 2024 is the year of the Dragon, meaning you’re the prime target for offending the God of Tai Sui.

You’re not used to setbacks and less-than-ideal outcomes, not when you’ve given your all, but that’s exactly what you’ll find yourself facing this year. Steady the course, because next year will be fantastic!

Dragon’s 2024 Love and Relationships Forecast
This is a year of conflict and strife in Dragon’s love life, and it doesn’t help that everything else upends at the same time. Try not to take it out on your loved ones, Dragon.

Single Dragons can forget about finding someone this year. Since there will be so much else on their mind already, anyone who comes into their radius will most likely be burned to a crisp.

Stay calm with your significant other, Dragon, if you’re already paired off, because this year, you may be inclined to lose your temper and blame everything on them, who only want the best for you.

Career Prospects for Dragon in 2024
This isn’t going to be a good career year for any Dragon, whether they work for someone else or for themselves. Those in an office may be very frustrated when their opinions are consistently ignored.

You’ll want to hang in there even so, Dragon, as this isn’t the best job-hunting year. You’ll need a steady paycheck to weather the storms of 2024, and new positions won’t be easy to find.

Those in business for themselves may face heavy losses this year, even having to close shop—at least temporarily—in the worst-case scenario. Stand where you fell, Dragon. We know you can rise again.

Dragon’s Wealth and Finance in 2024
It won’t be easy to make money this year. Those who are in sales or anything that depends on a bonus will only earn the base pay in 2024, as they’ll face some trouble with clients.

Dragons will face significant increases in their expenses—not that they want to, but because circumstances dictate that they must. For example, they might misplace their wallet or carry out necessary repairs on their house.

Needless to say, don’t invest your paycheck in anything risky or too speculative, Dragon. Stash most of what you earn for a rainy day, as there may well be a few of them in 2024. 

Health Predictions for Dragons in 2024
Dragons may not look their best all of this year, as they will be facing considerable problems with weakened immune and digestive systems. Try to boost your health with regular exercise and a healthy diet.

You may have survived on a diet of takeout and energy bars in the past. But Dragon, you’ll need to take care of your body to deal with the emotional and mental health challenges of 2024.

Likewise, this is a great year to take up yoga or meditation because Dragons are already prone to losing their temper or becoming agitated when things go relatively well. Don’t tax your body any more!
